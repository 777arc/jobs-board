Zarr is a format for the storage of chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays.
Built originally in Python for working with NumPy arrays, Zarr is now supported
in more than half a dozen languages. With funding from the Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative, we are looking to hire a full-time, open-source enthusiast for two
years to work as our community manager.

About the Role:

As the first full-time position dedicated to Zarr, you will have the
opportunity to shape the role to meet the needs of the community. You will be
an advocate for our strong, inclusive community, as well as define ways to
encourage new contributions while balancing the needs of a maturing data
format.

We are looking for someone who can:

* Foster and build relationships online
* Communicate clearly and technically with open-source developers
* Be a conduit to the research user communities
* Structure the project for growth and resiliency

This is a fully remote position. Responsibilities:

* Work with open source contributors to review, refine, and merge contributions
* Identify and mentor potential new core-developers
* Design a specification process that fosters quick decisions on emerging user cases
* Report developments via social media, the Zarr website and scientific publications
* Plan, organize, and run regular community calls
* Attend online and in-person events to speak about the project
* Help to build a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive community environment!

## Experience:

Candidates should have experience in one or more programming languages with a
strong tendency towards Python and be comfortable working with Git and GitHub.

## Compensation:

This role can be either a contract position or an employed position with fringe
benefits. $60,000 â€“ $80,000 per year dependent on position type and experience.
If you are looking for a flexible, open-source position that can make a world
of difference in bioimaging, climate science, or more. Please get in touch via
hiring@numfocus.org.
